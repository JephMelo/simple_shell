0x16. C - Simple Shell

In the context of software development, a "shell project" might refer to a basic or skeleton project structure that serves as a starting point for a larger application. It could include essential files, folders, and configurations but lacks the specific functionality of the final product. Developers often use shell projects to kickstart new projects and avoid repetitive setup tasks.
